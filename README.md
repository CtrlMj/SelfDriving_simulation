# SelfDriving_simulation
The output of this project is a virtual driver capable of steering a car on Udacity's self driving simulator https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
Following these steps:

1. Original simulator data will be acquired 
2. A convolutional neural network is built using Keras and trained on the data
3. The trained model is used in a server to command the simulator real-time
